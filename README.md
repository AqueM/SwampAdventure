# Swamp Adventure
This is the bare-bones beggining of a platformer game. It includes camera and movement controls, main menu and in-game UI, level/scene handler and score tracking.

It was created to learn gamedev and the engine itself, using only CC-licensed and royalty-free assets. All of the required credits can be accessed via the main menu.

## Requirements
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

To run the game, download the engine (it is runnable, no need to install), open the project and Play the game. There is currently only one level.
